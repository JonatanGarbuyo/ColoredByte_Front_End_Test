# Front End Test

Hello! Thank you so much for the interest in our Front End position. We created this test to see how you create a HTML, CSS and JS project. We know it is a bit annoying to have to build something but we hope this can be a positive experience!

We do this test because a lot of portfolio pieces are made from tutorials and don’t really represent real skills, making it super hard for us to go through hundreds of people and properly evaluate fairly. Random repositories without a context are also impossible to evaluate so we really appreciate the time you take to do this.

## How to do the test

1. Open this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/rGPjrHfxYkNY3PyxulJ09c/Front-End-Test?node-id=0%3A1)
2. Build this landing page using only HTML, CSS and JS
3. Submit a **google drive with the ZIP folder and the URL** once you deploy with [https://surge.sh/](https://surge.sh/)

### What we look at

1. How close you got to the Figma design visually
2. Functionality
3. Interactions and attention to detail
4. CSS Class Structure and code cleanness

### This test helps us understand how you create:

- CSS layouts
- CSS animation and interaction
- Javascript from scratch
- Javascript and CSS using a library
- API consumption
- Deployment
- Unknown technologies
